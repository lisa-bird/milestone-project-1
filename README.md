# Milestone 1 Project

The first milestone project calls for a website that can be used to inform users. After some thought, the decision was made to create a website for my local fitness club 'The Studio'. This site can be used by members and potential members. 


## Owners Goal
To attract interest in fun and enjoyable fitness classes and to retain present members.

## Audience
Predominently female users, local to the area, age 18 years upwards.

This website is made up of the following pages:
* Home - Introduction
* Fitness Classes
* Timetable
* Blog
* FAQs - Enquiry Form

# UX
## The Strategy
Business goals include traffic to the website with the possibility of generating new memberships. The audience of this website will mostly be female, aged between 18 - 60 years old. To capture the attention of this demorgrahpic the website has:

* Intuitive navigation
* Easy to find information
* Example playlist
* Videos of new classes
* Bright, consistent colours  

The website has been created with a user centered design to achieve a positive user experience, to make sure users enjoy using the website, wanting to come back again and again.

## The Scope
To achieve the user centered approach the website has these features included:

* Navigation bar linking to each page
* Call to action button on home page
* Downloadable timetable
* All links open in a new tab
* Links to social media platforms
* Enquiry form
* YouTube Videos embedded in the site
* Spotify Clubbercise playlist embedded in the site

## The Structure
The information on the website is structered in a logical way. The home page displays a bright hero image with the companys slogan 'No more boring workouts' plus an introduction paragraph, as well as a'sign up' button. The second page details a selection of the unusual fitness classes, including videos and a playlist. The timetable is displayed for the week, with the option to download as a PDF. The blog page is next, listing eight trending articles, with external links opening in a new tab. Lastly is the frequently asked question and equiry form page.

## The Skeleton
Here are the links to the wire frames for mobile, tablet and desktop. There are a couple of changes to the website from that of the wire frame design.

## The Surface

Inkeeping with 'The Studio's' brand identity I have used their corporate colours throughout:

![colour palette used](/images/colour-palette.png)

 I chose the font 'Lora' from Google Fonts. 

 "Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs."

### User - 5

A first time visitor has a question in mind but can not find the answer in the FAQ section. Can she enquire?

![Enquiry Form](/images/user-5.jpg)

An accordion of frequently asked questions has been inserted in page 'FAQs', when the question is selected the answer is displayed. An enquiry form is located under this, the user can then ask any questions that have not been answered. The form is labelled correctly with placeholder text to aid the user.

# Feedback

Layout of fitness pages on desktop - changed to a horizontal card, changed the size of the image and added css to the video

Colours of the accordion, a lot of research was done to dicover the correct class in Bootstrap to override the set class

Hero image only rendered locally - the path was wrong

Positioning of content
