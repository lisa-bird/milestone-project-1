# Milestone 1 Project

The first milestone project called for a website that can be used to inform its users. I decided to create a website for my local fitness club 'The Studio'. This site can be used by members and potential members. 


## Owners Goal
To attract interest in fun and enjoyable fitness classes and to retain present members.

## Audience
Predominently female users, local to the area, age 18 years upwards.

This website is made up of the following pages:
* Home - Introduction
* Fitness Classes
* Timetable
* Blog
* FAQs - Enquiry Form

# UX
## The Strategy
Business goals include traffic to the website with the possibility of generating new memberships. The audience of this website will mostly be female, aged between 18 - 60 years old. To capture the attention of this demorgrahpic I have ensured the website has:

* Intuitive navigation
* Easy to find information
* Example playlist
* Videos of new classes
* Bright, consistent colours  

I have created the website with a user centered design to achieve a positive user experience, to make sure users enjoy using the website, wanting to come back again and again.

## The Scope
To achieve the user centered approach the website have these features included:

* Navigation bar linking to each page
* Call to action button on home page
* Downloadable timetable
* All links open in a new tab
* Links to social media platforms
* Enquiry form
* YouTube Videos embedded in the site
* Spotify Clubbercise playlist embedded in the site

## The Structure
The information on the website is structered in a logical way. The home page displays a bright hero image with the companys slogan 'No more boring workouts' plus an introduction paragraph, as well as a'sign up' button. The second page details a selection of the unusual fitness classes, including videos and a playlist. The timetable is displayed for the week, with the option to download as a PDF. The blog page is next, listing eight trending articles, with external links opening in a new tab. Lastly is the frequently asked question and equiry form page.

## The Skeleton
Here is a link to the wire frames for mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The Surface

Inkeeping with 'The Studio's' brand identity I have used their corporate colours throughout:

 I chose the font 'Lora' from Google Fonts. 

 "Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs."
